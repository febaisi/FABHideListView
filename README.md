### Description

In initial project developed by makovkastar, this project intend to hide a custom FAB when scrollview, recyclerview or listview scroll down.
In my project I cleaned up all library and composed components dependences replacing custom FAB (imageview) to official google FAB component from Material Design Library (android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton). 



*In my example it was implemented only for ListView <br/>
